Resource Manager
- If out of minerals, order gatherers to mine from other explored
- Periodic resource rebalancing and maintainance of workers to make sure each one is collecting from correct the assigned sources

City Builing
- Use differnent padding for producing building/buildings with add ons/non-producing buildings
- Have a strategy in city build and make maze/wall structure

Scouting
- Perioding scouting
- Explore other resource minerals/gas sources

Micro
[DONE]- Group formation placement not randomized
- Retreat should choose different location to retreat to if the destination is not reachable/walkable/out of map.
- Target selection and prioritization (supporters, melee, ranged, air)
- Correct calculation of army sight and focus area not to hard code it (based on army size)
- Take attack type into consideration (Air/Ground targetability and prioritization)
- Use the more complex pro players Hit&Run: http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Vulture_Micro
- Even if a unit is being hit, not always it should run especially VS weak units, it should depend on the attacker and the unit itself
[DONE]- Retreat for melee enemies should be more smart to retreat if the enemy came too close e.g 64 pixel away


Macro
- Execute push/rush
- Realize when to retreat the whole army (i.e if combat simulation outcome is negative)
[AIIDE]- Defend base on rush with workers if no attackers exist or too few
- Handle city defending (SCVs run/attack and building lifting)

Planner
- Succeeding nodes dont expand, except root node, always expand

Strategy
- Detect enemy startegy from the first scouting and replan the counter

Protoss:
Zealot Rush -> 2 Gateways
DT Expand -> Expand 1 Gatways
