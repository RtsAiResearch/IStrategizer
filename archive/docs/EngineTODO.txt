Worker Manager
[DONE] - Periodic resource rebalancing and maintainance of workers to make sure each one is collecting from correct assigned sources
[DONE] - If out of minerals, order gatherers to mine from other explored
[DONE] - Repair damaged mech units

City Builing
[DONE] - Use differnent padding for producing building/buildings with add ons/non-producing buildings
[DONE] - Have a strategy in city build and make maze/wall structure
- Find out how to choose another build area if the choosen on is blocked always or find out the reason for choosing blocked areay? Bug maybe?

Scouting
- Perioding scouting
- Explore other resource minerals/gas sources

Micro
[DONE]- Group formation placement not randomized
[DONE]- Retreat for melee enemies should be more smart to retreat if the enemy came too close e.g 64 pixel away
[DONE]- Correct calculation of army sight and focus area not to hard code it (based on army size)
[DONE]- Retreat should choose different location to retreat to if the destination is not reachable/walkable/out of map.
[DONE]- Target selection and prioritization (supporterts, defensive structures, units HP, etc..)
- Take attack type into consideration (Air/Ground targetability and prioritization)
- Even if a unit is being hit, not always it should run especially VS weak units, it should depend on the attacker and the unit itself
[DONE] - Fix army states to work on Army units directly not cached ones
- Use the more complex pro players Hit&Run: http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Vulture_Micro

Macro
- Handle city defending (SCVs run/attack and building lifting)
[DONE] - Execute push/rush (Frontlines, Reinforcements, and Broken army)
- Realize when to retreat the whole army (i.e if combat simulation outcome is negative)
[AIIDE]- Defend base on rush with workers if no attackers exist or too few
- Switch to Siege Expand if enemy is playing defensive

#define PLAYER(playerId) (playerId == -1 ? Broodwar->neutral() : Broodwar->getPlayer(playerId))

Planner
[DONE] - Fix planner goal resource sharing and synchronization bugs
- Perioding maintainance of the already succeeding goals, if failed reopen them
- Need to identify Train Army goals with more strong parameters (e.g map of each unit type and its count)
- Train adaptation to train Vultures from Factories with no machine shops first before trying to train from ones with Machines shops
Strategy
- Detect enemy startegy from the first scouting and replan the counter
